# Project 10

Use a generative model for the Yale faces dataset which also encodes the facial expression in some way. Evaluate the model, as well as its ability to change the facial expression for a given image by changing the according label in the model (e.g. CGAN or infoGAN).

# Project 11

Devise a classifier for the German traffic sign data set (you might use an existing network). Try to attack the model using several different attacks. Include, among others, a few pixel attack. Evaluate the success rate of different attack methods and discuss in how far the attacks go unnoticed by a human.
